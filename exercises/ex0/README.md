# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will gather important information to execute your exercise.

## Find your Group Number

During this Teched exercise, you will create a CAP application and deploy it into an SAP BTP subaccount.
To avoid conflicts between two applications, it is very important that you know your place number and execute the exercise using this place number.
Please check the sign on your table. The number on this sign is your place number. 

## Login Information

Please replace the _**XXX**_ in the user name with your place number (e.g. AD268-001@education.cloud.sap).

In the SAP BTP Cockpit, you will only see the subaccount that is relevant for you, based on your place number.
