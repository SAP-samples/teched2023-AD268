<h1>Important Disclaimers on Legal Aspects</h1>

<div><span>Coding Samples</span>
    <p>Any software coding and/or code lines / strings
        ("Code") included in this documentation are only examples and are not intended to be
        used in a productive system environment. The Code is only intended to better explain
        and visualize the syntax and phrasing rules of certain coding. SAP does not warrant
        the correctness and completeness of the Code given herein, and SAP shall not be
        liable for errors or damages caused by the usage of the Code, unless damages were
        caused by SAP intentionally or by SAP's gross negligence.</p>
</div>
<div><span>Accessibility</span>
    <p>The information contained in the SAP documentation
        represents SAP's current view of accessibility criteria as of the date of
        publication; it is in no way intended to be a binding guideline on how to ensure
        accessibility of software products. SAP specifically disclaims any liability with
        respect to this document and no contractual obligations or commitments are formed
        either directly or indirectly by this document. </p>
</div>
<div><span>Gender-Neutral Language</span>
    <p>As far as possible, SAP documentation is
        gender neutral. Depending on the context, the reader is addressed directly with
        "you", or a gender-neutral noun (such as "sales person" or "working days") is used.
        If when referring to members of both sexes, however, the third-person singular
        cannot be avoided or a gender-neutral noun does not exist, SAP reserves the right to
        use the masculine form of the noun and pronoun. This is to ensure that the
        documentation remains comprehensible. </p>
</div>
<div><span>Internet Hyperlinks</span>
    <p>The SAP documentation may contain hyperlinks
        to the Internet. These hyperlinks are intended to serve as a hint about where to
        find related information. SAP does not warrant the availability and correctness of
        this related information or the ability of this information to serve a particular
        purpose. SAP shall not be liable for any damages caused by the use of related
        information unless damages have been caused by SAP's gross negligence or willful
        misconduct. Regarding link classification, see: <a href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer/" target="_blank">http://help.sap.com/disclaimer</a>
