XSA TO CAP Migration: Automated Script
=====================================
## Introduction:
The Automated script is used to migrate applications from HANA CDS to CAP CDS. It is written in the NodeJS framework. The script will create a new CAP application and copy the database of the XSA application and modify it to support the CAP format. It covers the following conversions:
- Create an initial CAP application.
- Based on the number of containers used in the source application, it will create multiple db folders in the CAP application.
- Copy all the files from the respective database folder of the XSA Application to the db folders( Eg: db, db1 and so on) of the newly created CAP application.
- Change the extension of the hdbcds files to cds.
- Modify the notation in view definitions from `""` to `![]`, this [delimiter](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#delimited-identifiers) makes the processing in CAPCDS more reliable.
- Change the HANA CDS Datatypes to CAP CDS Datatypes.

    | HANA CDS | CAP CDS |
    |----------|---------|
    |LocalDate|Date|
    |LocalTime|Time|
    |UTCDateTime|DateTime|
    |UTCTimestamp|Timestamp|
    |BinaryFloat|Double|
- Change `@OData.publish:true` with `@cds.autoexpose`.
- Change `@Comment` with `@title`.
- Change the Artifact table type to type or remove them as CAP CDS doesn't generate table types anymore. We will create a .hdbtabletype files for each table type definition in the later steps.
- Convert temporary entities to regular entities.
- Move all the CDS files from their respective folders (Eg: src/) to the respective db folder of the CAP project. If cds files are inside the src folder then the deployment will fail because of where the "cds" plugin is. As per CAP, the cds files shouldnâ€™t be in src folder because only the gen folder will push the data, but here in XSA application, all the artifacts will reside inside the src folder. So we have to move the cds files to the db folder for the deployment to work correctly.
- Compile the cds files and create a log file.
- Enhance Project Configuration for SAP HANA Cloud by running the command `cds add hana`.
- Enhance Project Configuration for XSUAA by running the command `cds add xsuaa`.
- Generate MTA deployment descriptor (mta.yaml) by running the command `cds add mta`.
- Install the npm node modules in the CAP project by running the command `npm install`.
- Rename the other Hana database artifacts to Hana Cloud supported format. That is entities should be in Uppercase and `.` to be replaced by `_`
- Copy the app folder in the source to target
- modify the .hdinamespace files

## Requirements:
1. We can use SAP BAS or VScode for script execution.
2. The code for the source application should be cloned into a local system directory.

## Usage:
1. Clone the git repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.tools.sap/BTP-E2EScenarioValidation/techeddemo.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the script folder.
   ```
   cd migration-script
   ```
3. Install the required node modules by running the command `npm install`.
4. Execute the script by running the command `npm run start`.
5. Once the script is running, provide the below parameters to execute the script

## Note:
- This script is used to migrate the demo application to CAP. For other projects, we have to adjust the calcview.xsl with the attributes used in the project before running the script.
- The rename can be called for different Hana Artifacts. List the file extensions in the "config.json.tpl" file.
  
  **Note:** It doesnt work on hdbrole as it also renames the keywords. So if a new artifact other than the given list is added here, make sure to check if the rename is done correctly before deployment.
- For Multiple containers, mta.yaml has to be updated with service replacements. Example: [mta.yaml](https://github.tools.sap/BTP-E2EScenarioValidation/techeddemo/blob/main/targetcap/mta.yaml#L48-L55)
